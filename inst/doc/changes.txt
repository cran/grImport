Changes from version 0.2-3 to 0.2-4
===================================

1.  Fix to PostScriptTrace() so that full file paths work on Windows.

    Thanks to Duncan Murdoch and Alex Hanke for bug reports.


Changes from version 0.2-2 to 0.2-3
===================================

1.  Fix to explodePaths() so that it handles paths that do not
    need exploding.


Changes from version 0.1 to 0.2
=================================

1.  Importing text was not working at all;  this now works, though
    imported text is just character outlines.  The default drawing
    method just strokes the character outline;  you can attempt
    to fill the characters, in which case, the first outline in each
    character is filled in the current colour, then all subsequent 
    outlines for the character are filled using a user-specified 
    background colour (default is "white").  This a very simple-
    minded approach, but it does work for some straightforward
    examples (an example where it doesn't work is the dot on a 
    lower-case "i").

    This change adds a new "char" type of path (to the existing
    "stroke" and "fill" types) and a new "PictureChar" class
    (to the existing "PictureStroke" and "PictureFill" classes).

2.  A path with zero locations used to cause an error;  such
    paths are now just not drawn.

3.  A new function explodePaths() breaks up any path with multiple
    'move' operations into separate paths.

4.  Added some tests in test/ dir.

[thanks to Ken Knoblauch for bug reports and testing 
 that led to these improvements]
